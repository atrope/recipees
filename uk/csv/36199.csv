Spaghetti bolognese my way,"['vegetable oil, as needed for cooking', '2 tablespoons dried mixed herbs', '1 onion, finely chopped', '2 teaspoons minced garlic', '500g minced beef', '2 (400g) tins chopped tomatoes', '1 tablespoon tomato puree', '1 tablespoon tomato ketchup', '2 stock cubes', '75ml red wine (cheap stuff does the job fine)']"
